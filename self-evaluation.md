# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?
    - It quickly returns many instances of something without you having to type out each one.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
    - I still need to try and learn some of the many different methods used on arrays. I will accomplish this by looking through ruby-doc and testing out interesting ones I find.
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?
    - I repeatedly ran the file in terminal to see how my changes were being seen. This combined with small adjustments to see how the code reacts was helpful to me. Also I was able to practice using better keywords in google.
